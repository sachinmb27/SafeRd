This project was designed to predict the anomalies present in the roads using smartphone. This work was done as a part of an academic project.

## About
Road conditions in India are poor which results in inconvenience and discomfort to the drivers. This condition prevails because of the presence of road anomalies such as manhole covers, pits, potholes etc. in high numbers. These anomalies not only deplete the vehicle condition but also acts as an unwanted hinderance to vehicle’s acceleration. Also, due to the growth of self – driving automatic cars, the road anomalies will be a huge problem for the smooth operation of such cars. Using the driver behavior as input parameters which include sudden braking, left and right turns. And also, the readings from the gyroscope, GPS and linear accelerometer sensors are used to differentiate between the road anomalies based on their severity. After completing the process, the recordings will be embedded in a geographical map, so that users can be indicated about the road anomalies on their route. This work also factors the speed of the vehicle, so that the users can be notified at the right time to reduce the impact from the anomalies.
